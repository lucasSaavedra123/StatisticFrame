StatisticFrame is a set of classes and tools that use most used machine learning and statistics libraries. Why? We take advantage of OOP concepts that those libraries don't. Use it. It's very comfortable and declarative.

# Requirements

What we need? Just Python 3.
First, we need to install all required libraries. To do that, type:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Dockerization is a great idea. We could develop an API to be worldwide used for cloud services and stuff like that. But by now, it's used in this way.

# FAQ

## How do I run tests?

Move to `tests` folder and type

    python -m unittest discover -s . -p 'test_*.py' -v -b
